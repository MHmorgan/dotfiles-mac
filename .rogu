# Install items are custom shell items which install
# something, and Rogu are responsible for running them.
#
# The `install` script is used to install it.
# The optional `uninstall` script is used to uninstall it.
#
# The `check` script is used to check if it's installed,
# and must return 0 if it is.
#
# If an `update` script is provided, it will be run during
# `rogu sync` if the `check` script returns 0.
